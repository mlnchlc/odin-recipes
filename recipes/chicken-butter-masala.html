  <h2 id="description">Description</h2>
  <p>
    Chicken Butter Masala is a popular Indian dish of grilled chicken
    simmered in a smooth, silky and creamy onion
    tomato and cashew gravy. This finger-licking good
    curried dish is popular on the restaurant menus. Also known as
    Butter Chicken Masala, this is a modified version of the
    authentic North Indian Butter Chicken.
