  <h2 id="description">Description</h2>
  <p>
    A curry serves best with naan that is unleavened bread. Traditionally made in ‘Tandoor 
    or clay oven' but at home, we will be making it in the oven and/or on the stovetop. 
    Naan is not eaten solely but acts as assortments with meat, veggies, or egg items.

    <li>Put the yeast and sugar to warm milk in a large mixing bowl and stir well. Leave it for 3-5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Put the flour and salt into a large mixing bowl and whisk to combine.  Sprinkle additional flour as needed to keep the dough from sticking to the sides.</li>
    <li>Once the dough is soft and ready, apply oil on it and cover it with a soft cloth. Rest it for 2–3 hours.</li>
    <li>Knead the dough again, sprinkle all-purpose flour, and knead until smooth.</li>
    <li>Divide dough into 4 equal pieces. Form pieces into balls. Roll out dough balls to desired thickness (about the size of a small tortilla).</li>
    <li>Now transfer the naan to the foiled baking tray and bake in preheated at 180 C for 30-35 minutes.</li>
    <li>After baking, brush the top with butter and cut it into four pieces and serve. Enjoy!</li>
